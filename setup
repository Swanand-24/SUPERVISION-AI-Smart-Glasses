# SUPERVISION - Project Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the **SUPERVISION AI Smart Glasses for Visually Impaired People** on a **Raspberry Pi 4B**.

---

## 1. Set Up the Raspberry Pi 4B  

### 1.1 Install Raspbian OS  
1. Download the latest Raspbian OS image from the [official Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/).  
2. Use software like **Balena Etcher** to flash the OS image onto a microSD card.  
3. Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it up.  

### 1.2 Initial Configuration  
1. Connect the Raspberry Pi to a **monitor, keyboard, and mouse**.  
2. Complete the initial setup wizard:  
   - Configure **Wi-Fi**  
   - Set the **locale**  
   - Update the **software**  

### 1.3 Install VNC Viewer  
1. Install **VNC Viewer** on your system.  
2. Using Raspberry Piâ€™s **IP Address**, connect Raspberry Pi to **VNC Viewer** to start the OS.  

---

## 2. Install Necessary Software and Libraries  

### 2.1 Update the System  
```bash
sudo apt update  
sudo apt upgrade  
```

### 2.2 Install Python and Pip  
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip  
```

### 2.3 Install OpenCV  
```bash
sudo apt install libopencv-dev python3-opencv  
```

### 2.4 Install TensorFlow and Keras  
```bash
pip3 install tensorflow keras  
```

### 2.5 Install Additional Libraries  
```bash
pip3 install numpy scipy imutils  
sudo apt install espeak  
```

## 3. Set Up the Camera  

### 3.1 Enable the Camera Interface  
1. Open the Raspberry Pi configuration tool:  
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config  
   libcamera-hello  
   ```
2. Navigate to **Interfacing Options** and enable the **camera**.  
3. Reboot the Raspberry Pi:  
   ```bash
   sudo reboot  
   ```

---

## 4. Connect the Ultrasonic Sensor  

### 4.1 Wiring  
- **VCC** â†’ **5V** pin on the Raspberry Pi  
- **GND** â†’ Ground pin on the Raspberry Pi  
- **TRIG** â†’ **GPIO 23**  
- **ECHO** â†’ **GPIO 24**  

### 4.2 Install GPIO Library  
```bash
sudo apt install python3-rpi.gpio  
```

---

## 5. Download and Set Up the SUPERVISION Code  

### 5.1 Download Code Files  
1. Download the project code from Google Drive:  
   - [SUPERVISION Project Code](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1inbCx8TVoCqqKD_S0SUUODfJ1cdpVXyd?usp=sharing)  

### 5.2 Prepare the Model  
1. Download the pre-trained **MobileNetV2 model** and **COCO names file**.  
2. Ensure they are placed in the correct directory as specified in your code.  

---

## 6. Run the Script and Connect Bluetooth  

### 6.1 Run the Object Detection Script  
```bash
python object_detection1.py --labels labels.txt --model mobilenet_v2.tflite  
```

### 6.2 Connect Bluetooth Earphones  
1. Enable Bluetooth on the Raspberry Pi.  
2. Connect to the Bluetooth earphones for **voice feedback**.  

---

## 7. User Setup  

### 7.1 Wear the Prototype  
1. Carefully place the glasses on the user.  
2. Ensure Bluetooth earphones are **connected** for voice commands.  

### 7.2 Running the Script  
- The script runs for **1 minute** and then stops.  

### 7.3 To Re-run the Script  
```bash
python object_detection1.py --labels labels.txt --model mobilenet_v2.tflite  
```

---

## 8. Closing the Script  
1. Close the terminal window.  
2. Shutdown the Raspberry Pi safely:  
   ```bash
   sudo shutdown -h now  
   ```
